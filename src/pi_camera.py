    The class captures images using the Raspberry Pi camera, checks the image quality based on sharpness and brightness,

	Attributes:
    - attempts (int): The number of attempts to take a picture in succession.

	Methods:
    - internet_connected(): Checks if the device has an active internet connection.
    - capture_image(): Captures an image and saves it to a specified location.
	- check_image(imgPath): Checks the quality of the given image and saves it with additional information based on the evaluation.
	- calculate_brightness(image): Calculates the average brightness of an image.
	- try_again(): Retries the image capture process after a failed attempt.
	- processing_data(image, brightness, sharpness): Add annotations to brightness and sharpness information to an image.
